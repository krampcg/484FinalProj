\textit{Shallow-Water Theory} is the canonical mathematical model for waves propagating non-dispersively in a medium which is much wider than it is deep. The \textit{shallow-water equations} are a system of linear partial-differential equations at the center of Shallow-Water Theory. The linear shallow-water equations for a single spatial dimension $x$ and  seafloor shape $H=H(x,y)$ are
\begin{gather}\label{eq:shallow}
    \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( gH\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( gH\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} \right).
\end{gather}
