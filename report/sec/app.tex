The shallow water equation requires a choice of a particular seafloor shape $H=H(x,y)$. To test the shallow-water equation, the geography of eastern Japan, specifically $\overline{\text{O}}\text{kuma}$, Fukushima will be used and a tsunami resulting from an earthquake with its epicenter at the same location as the $\text{T}\overline{\text{o}}\text{hoku}$ earthquake will be simulated. If the tsnumai's wave front reaches the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, it will be demonstrated whether or not the shallow-wave equation is suitable for simulating not only tsunamis, but areas that may be at risk of flooding from tsunamis.
